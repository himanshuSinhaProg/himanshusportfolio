MHS Inc. Workplace Bullying and Harassment Policy Statement
1. Purpose and Scope MHS Inc. is dedicated to fostering a safe, respectful, and supportive work environment for all employees. We believe that a workplace free from bullying, harassment, and intimidation not only enhances morale but also contributes to overall organizational effectiveness. This policy serves to establish clear behavioral standards and demonstrates our commitment to prevent, address, and resolve any instances of bullying and harassment. Our policy ensures all employees, whether permanent, temporary, casual, contract, or student workers, understand the expectations regarding acceptable behavior and the steps they should follow if they experience or witness unacceptable behavior. This policy applies to all work-related activities, including but not limited to in-person interactions, telecommunication, digital or electronic communication, and company-sponsored events, whether they occur on or off the premises. 2. Policy Statement MHS Inc. maintains a zero-tolerance stance against any behavior that could be deemed bullying or harassment. We are committed to ensuring all employees work in an environment of respect, trust, and inclusivity. Our organization does not tolerate any behavior or communication, either intentional or unintentional, that could harm, intimidate, or demean individuals within our workforce. Any reported incident of harassment or bullying will be investigated impartially and addressed in a timely manner, adhering to principles of fairness and confidentiality. 3. Definition of Bullying and Harassment To prevent misunderstandings, MHS Inc. provides the following definitions and examples. Bullying and harassment are defined as any acts, behaviors, or communications that a reasonable individual would recognize as likely to cause humiliation, intimidation, or distress to another person in the workplace.

Reasonable management actions taken fairly and respectfully, such as performance evaluations, workload adjustments, and disciplinary actions, do not constitute bullying or harassment. 4. Employee Responsibilities MHS Inc. expects all employees to contribute to a positive workplace culture by upholding our commitment to respect and dignity. As part of this commitment, employees must: - **Conduct themselves respectfully** in all interactions with colleagues, managers, and clients, avoiding any behaviors that might be perceived as bullying or harassment. - **Report any incidents** of bullying or harassment they experience or observe, as well as support colleagues who may be affected by these behaviors. - **Comply with all organizational policies** regarding workplace conduct and actively participate in any training sessions provided. 5. Reporting and Addressing Incidents Employees who experience or witness bullying or harassment are encouraged to report it promptly, either to their direct supervisor or the Human Resources department. To ensure a supportive environment, MHS Inc. has developed multiple reporting channels, allowing employees to report concerns anonymously if preferred. All reports will be treated with confidentiality to the fullest extent, and employees can expect a non-retaliatory approach to their concerns. To facilitate efficient handling of complaints, employees are encouraged to provide specific details, such as dates, times, descriptions of the incident, and names of individuals involved. MHS Inc. is committed to addressing each report with sensitivity and ensuring all parties are kept informed of the investigation's progress. 6. Investigation Procedure Upon receiving a report, MHS Inc. will initiate a thorough investigation to understand the facts and circumstances. Our process includes the following steps: - **Preliminary assessment:** HR will determine if immediate actions, such as separation of the parties involved, are necessary to maintain a respectful and safe environment. - **Confidential interviews:** Investigators will conduct private interviews with all relevant parties, including witnesses, to obtain an unbiased account of the situation.
