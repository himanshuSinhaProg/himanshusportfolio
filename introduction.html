            <p> This website has been created with a purpose to show case to the potential employer , Himanshu's Portfolio which  was created as an exercise towards 
                his assignment in BUS 330(Communications for Influence and Impact) that he undertook as a student at Camosun College, Victoria. The contents on this page were created
                towards the assignments he submitted to the instructor for evaluation that would contribute 35 percent towards his final grade.

                Zoom Out using Ctrl + (-) to view the full content . The website follows a simple design, nothing fancy or attractive , since the objective is to convey to the reader  Himanshu's
                 proficiency in writing and documentation.

                Thank You for understanding.
