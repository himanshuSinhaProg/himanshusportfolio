            <p>The Evolution of Open AI in Education: A Studentâ€™s Perspective

As I complete my program at Camosun College this year, one of my current courses, BUS 330: Communications for Influence and Impact, has given me an opportunity to reflect on the transformative role of AI in education.

In just two years, Iâ€™ve observed a remarkable shift in attitudes towards AI tools like GPT and Gemini in the learning environment. During my first program at Durham, the use of AI was strictly prohibited, with concerns about plagiarism. Now, in my current course, weâ€™re encouraged to use AI toolsâ€”provided we document the prompts we use.

This shift highlights the growing acceptance of AI as a valuable educational resource. It underscores the importance of writing effective promptsâ€”the foundation of meaningful and unique AI-driven outputs.

Crafting a precise prompt is truly an art. It determines not only the relevance of the response but also its uniqueness. For instance, writing a prompt that is goal-oriented and aligns with your desired outcome can significantly enhance the quality of the results.

GPT can guide onethrough challengesâ€”whether itâ€™s debugging code (Co-Pilot Github) or mapping out complex processes. 

Although GPT doesnâ€™t have RPA capabilities, it excels at providing actionable steps toward achieving specific objectives and even provides steps for resolution if you find yourself stuck somewhere while coding or troubleshooting maybe my ovenðŸ“º,just take out your phone ðŸ“± from the pocket and ðŸ“¸ paste that image directly to GPT and you will see GPT providing the steps to resolve that obstacle that seemed challenging to you, but now that you followed the steps as it is, providing your perspective in detail step by step.
It just works out for you perfectly in the end.

Isn't it phenomenal?ðŸ”¥

This utility is particularly useful for our final assignment, where we are to submit an AI Cheat Sheet. We document our prompts and show how they helped us achieve the final results, aligning with a rubric provided by our instructor. This task has taught me how important it is to refine prompts for optimal outcomes.

Interestingly, while experimenting on my friendâ€™s computer, I noticed that variations in prompts led to unique outputs for both of us. This highlights the creative potential of AI and reinforces the idea that no two same prompts yield identical resultsâ€”an exciting realization for students exploring AI . Now that GPT customizes the response specifically as per the user making this all much exciting and riveting to use. It feels, AI knows you.

In conclusion, the more time you invest in crafting the right prompt, the better and more personalized the results. Tools like ChatGPT are not just a luxury but a necessity in modern education, empowering students to learn, explore, and grow creatively..</p>
