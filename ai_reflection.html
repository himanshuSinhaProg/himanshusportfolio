As I approach the completion of my program at Camosun College this year, my course, BUS 330: Communications for Influence and Impact, has provided me with a chance to reflect on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping education. Over the past two years, I have witnessed an incredible transformation in the way AI tools like GPT and Gemini are perceived and utilized within learning environments.

During my previous program at Durham, the use of AI tools was strictly prohibited, with faculty citing concerns about plagiarism and academic integrity. Fast forward to today, and the narrative has changed drastically. In my current course, we are not only allowed but actively encouraged to use AI tools, provided we document the prompts we employ. This remarkable shift demonstrates the increasing acceptance of AI as a legitimate and powerful educational resource.

The Art of Crafting Prompts
This newfound openness to AI has highlighted an important skill: crafting effective prompts. Writing a precise and goal-oriented prompt is not just a technical skill but an art form. The quality of a prompt determines the relevance, uniqueness, and depth of the AI-generated output. A well-crafted prompt ensures that the response aligns closely with the desired outcomes, whether it’s solving a technical challenge, debugging code (as with GitHub Co-Pilot), or strategizing complex processes.

For example, GPT might not have robotic process automation (RPA) capabilities, but it excels in providing actionable steps toward resolving issues. A seemingly insurmountable challenge—whether it’s troubleshooting a coding error or fixing your oven—becomes manageable when broken down by AI. Imagine snapping a picture of an error on your phone and using GPT to guide you through the solution step by step. The precision and clarity of its advice make it feel as though the tool understands you personally—a truly phenomenal experience.

AI in Education: A Practical Example
In BUS 330, our final assignment, an AI Cheat Sheet, exemplifies how AI tools are integrated into modern education. This task requires us to document the prompts we’ve used and demonstrate how they’ve helped us achieve specific results. It aligns with a rubric provided by our instructor, emphasizing not only the utility of AI but also the importance of refining prompts to achieve optimal outcomes.

While experimenting with a friend’s computer, I discovered that even slight variations in prompts resulted in distinct outputs. This underscores the creative potential of AI and reinforces the idea that no two identical prompts yield the same results. This adaptability makes AI an exciting and dynamic tool for students, offering unique and tailored insights based on user-specific needs.

Personalization and the Future
The personalization offered by tools like ChatGPT has elevated the learning experience. The more effort you invest in crafting precise prompts, the more personalized and impactful the results become. This realization transforms AI tools from optional aids into indispensable components of modern education. They empower students to explore ideas, solve problems, and express their creativity in ways previously unimaginable.

Conclusion
In conclusion, AI tools like GPT are revolutionizing the educational landscape. They’re not just conveniences—they’re necessities for students seeking to learn and grow in today’s dynamic environment. The ability to refine prompts, experiment creatively, and harness AI’s potential equips students with valuable skills that extend far beyond the classroom. AI, when used effectively, is more than a tool; it’s a partner in learning and discovery, making education more exciting and accessible for all.
