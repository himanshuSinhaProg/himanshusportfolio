(Gartner: Explore a Strategy for Sustained Employee and Organization Performance)
Purpose
The purpose of this briefing note is to summarize the six pillars of strategy that lead to sustained employee and organizational performance.
Background
Businesses nowadays struggle with issues of low employee productivity and employee morale, which ultimately hurts the sole purpose of the existence of a firm.
Gartner, a leading consulting agency proposes six pillars around which organizations can center their actions to achieve sustained employee and organizational performance.
That are:-
i) Reinvent Employee Value Proposition ii) Proactive Initiatives for Employee Well-Being.
iii) Get the DEI angle right. iv)Enable employees to achieve their full potential
v) Create a human-centric workplace. vi)Unlock productivity with Artificial Intelligence.
Current Status & Recommendations
Organizations nowadays orient their actions around the above-mentioned pillars, however, their execution is not how a Human-Powered Enterprise would execute.
PILLAR 1
➢
Reinventing Employee Value Proposition (EVP) means pivoting from the traditional “Features” model to the “Feelings” Model such that an exceptional life experience is provided, not just an employee experience.
Recommendation #1 : A day of “Bring your family to Work” should be celebrated once a year to tie together the personal and professional persona of an employee leading to an enhanced life experience at work.
PILLAR 2
➢
Proactively seeking initiatives for employee well-being requires active participation from employees in framing innovative techniques that would foster their well-being.
➢
47 % of the respondents selected “Employee Engagement” as the most important metric to measure the effectiveness of Well-Being Programs.
Recommendation #2: HR should regularly poll employees on alternative options for well-being events to gauge their preferences and better understand the pulse of the workforce for Employee Engagement initiatives.
PILLAR 3
➢
To get the DEI angle right organizational leaders would have to embed DEI throughout the organization to achieve scalable and sustainable results across the organization.
Recommendation #3: HR should organize a ‘Culture Day’ where distinct, cultures, languages, and cuisines of the employees are recognized and celebrated.
PILLAR 4
➢
One of the ways to enable employees to achieve their full potential is by removing emotional barriers to leadership.
➢
A 30-percentage-point improvement in employee well-being was observed under human-centric leaders, highlighting the scarcity and value of strong leadership.
Recommendation #4: Leadership development programs should focus on selecting future leaders through clear criteria to ensure a fair and transparent process.
PILLAR 5
➢
To create a human-centric workplace employees should be equipped with the freedom to choose their own workplace and work schedule.
➢
Research indicates that employee engagement for Gen Z employees jumped by 5 % when their organization did not implement on-site mandated work requirements.
Recommendation #5: HR should conduct routine surveys to assess the Work-from-home readiness of their employees.
PILLAR 6
➢
To unlock productivity with AI, leaders should orient an organizational culture of embracing AI as the skill of the future for modernizing the workforce.
Recommendation #6: Conduct regular assessments to evaluate AI usage and effectiveness within the organization.</p>
